# Hi there, I'm Mert! 👋

### 🚛 From Global Shipping to Backend Development
I am a **Logistics Expert** with 7 years of experience in global liner operations (Hapag-Lloyd), production, and customs. I am currently transitioning into **Backend Development** to build tech solutions for the industry I know best.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: **Python Fundamentals & Backend Basics**
- 🛳️ Industry Expertise: **Liner Shipping, Import/Export, Supply Chain Management**
- 🌍 Languages: **English (Professional), Turkish (Native)**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've spent 7 years solving logistics puzzles; now I'm solving them with code!
